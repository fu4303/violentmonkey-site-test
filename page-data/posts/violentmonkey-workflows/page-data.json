In CWS we have to clarify why each permission is required in <code class=\"language-text\">manifest.json</code>. <strong>In AMO and MEA we need to provide the source code and tell the reviewers how our project is built, then the reviewers build the package from scratch and compare it to the version we submitted to make sure they are the same.</strong> So if you are installing Violentmonkey from the official links, you don't need to worry about trackers or malicious code that is not shown in the source code because the reviewers have confirmed they are clean.</p>\n<p>One exception is the beta release for Firefox, which is self-signed and self-hosted, aka. unlisted version -- AMO has <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/02/28/discontinuing-support-for-beta-versions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">dropped support for beta versions and recommended the unlisted version for testing purpose</a> since 2018. We serve our beta versions on top of this feature, and the whole process is automated via GitHub actions as mentioned above. The generated package is immediately uploaded to AMO and signed, and then uploaded to GitHub assets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-the-source-code-compiled\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-is-the-source-code-compiled\" aria-label=\"why is the source code compiled permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why is the source code compiled?</h2>\n<p>Since we are in 2020s, this question should not be asked by a web developer. If you have employed such a guy, trust me, he/she should be fired.</p>\n<p>We are using many lovely features in our project, some from ESNext, and some are popular in development but not supported natively by any browser. So we compile those parts to legacy JavaScript code to make the extension work for more browsers.</p>\n<p>For example, we build UI in Violentmonkey with <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vue.js</a>, a popular framework good at building complexed UIs. It depends on quite a few custom annotations which need to be transformed to vanilla JavaScript and CSS so that the browser can understand.</p>\n<p>There are also some constants injected at compilation time so that we don't need to hard-code them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-the-generated-code-minified\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-is-the-generated-code-minified\" aria-label=\"why is the generated code minified permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why is the generated code minified?</h2>\n<p>Generally, the larger the code is, the longer it takes for the parser to parse. So it is very common for web apps to minify the code before publication.</p>\n<p>Another reason which is even more important is to strip the debugging related code because it actually runs in browser and slowers the runtime. It may be important for developers to find bugs but useless for normal users.</p>\n<p>This is mainly what code minification does, but not code obfuscation. Code obfuscation usually encodes the minified code to make it harder to read. As a result, it becomes slower because decoding is required before the code can execute. We don't need this and we have never included such tools in our project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-build-the-code-by-yourself\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-build-the-code-by-yourself\" aria-label=\"how to build the code by yourself permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How to build the code by yourself?</h2>\n<p>If you don't believe us and want to build the code by yourself, you can clone the Violentmonkey project and follow the build steps in README.</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/development/"],"type":"posts"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Violentmonkey Workflows","tags":["development"],"date":"2021-02-19 21:21:04+0800","sidebar":null},"tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#workflows\">Workflows</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#development\">Development</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#release\">Release</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#publication\">Publication</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#why-is-the-source-code-compiled\">Why is the source code compiled?</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#why-is-the-generated-code-minified\">Why is the generated code minified?</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#how-to-build-the-code-by-yourself\">How to build the code by yourself?</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/violentmonkey-workflows/","type":"posts"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1878747374","2344890832","3365866253","3486277714"]}
